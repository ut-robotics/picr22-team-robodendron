For the mainboard the pinouts of the STM32441 are the same as in the test electronics, the soldering pads for the arrival of the motors and the outputs of the motors are placed as too where their positions should be on the robot. The placement of the components is made to be as close as possible to each of the components it is linked with. The mainboard is currently unfinished due to several delays explained in the main branch.
