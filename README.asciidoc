Day 1 of project bootcamp. The whole team was familiarizing with the project's
structure and started working with other contestants than Robodendron's members.

Some worked on electronics while others played with mechanics and software.

Day 2 of the project's bootcamp. The tasks were swapped between electronics, mechanics
and software development so that the whole team members could be introduced to the
concepts to be used in this project.

=== Monday 2022-09-05
Decide the tasks all together +
*Malcom:* start working on camera to find the ball (2h) +
*Leon:* start working on the test robot and get the sizes with the calliper, start thinking about a first launcher (2h) +
*Nathan:* soldering of missing parts from the test robot (2h) +
*Gautier:* started designing the ramp for the thrower with right ejection angle. (2h) +

=== Thursday 2022-09-08
*Malcom:* work on the omni wheels, to make them rotate (2h) +
*Leon:* build the thrower and get used to fusion (2h) +
*Nathan:* finished the soldering, improved some of the connections, tried to make the motors work (2h) +
*Gautier:* More tweaking on the thrower ramp (2h) +


=== Monday 2022-09-12
*Malcom:* work on the mapping of the omniwheels to give a direction, and start the programation of the motion (2h) +
*Leon:* finish the launcher (2h) +
*Nathan:* the motors worked it was due to some cabling error (2h) +
*Gautier:* final work on the ramp design with real test robot CAD (2h) +

*Malcom:*
*Leon:* Design of a new fixture component to attach the new omniwheels to the
motor axles. This new design should be much easier to attach to the wheel and 
it should grip the motor axles much better. (2h) +
*Nathan:* Cable management on the test robot. (2h) +
*Gautier:* Design of the new omniwheels (one single piece should be enough as
opposed to the two parts taking the bearings and their axles in "sandwich"). (2h) +

== Monday 2022-09-26
*Malcom:* Writing a code to spin the robot and stop when the ball is detected (2h) +
*Leon:*  Improvements on the thrower's structure with standoffs. The whole assembly should be much more rigid. (3h) +
*Nathan:*  Fixed the motor controllers to the frame (1h); started learning about PCB design (1h30) +
*Gautier:* Print of wheel prototypes to figure out the best tolerance settings for press fitting the roller axles. (3h) +

== Thursday 2022-09-29
*Malcom:* Writing a code that not only looks for the ball by spinning, but also moves the robot
towards the ball with a speed proportional to the distance to the target. (2h) +
*Leon:* Improvement ont the thrower (tolerances, holes...) (3h) +
*Nathan:* Continued learning about PCBs and searched some components (2h30) +
*Gautier:* Design, 3D printing and installation of the new omniwheel on the test robot.
Some heated inserts are installed to provide better fixture. Two designs for wheel hubs (fixture to the motor shafts) were
also attempted. A new single-piece design was born from issues with two-part hub/wheel. (6h30) +

*Gautier* Print of the latest omniwheel design integrating both the wheel and the hub in one piece. (2h) +
